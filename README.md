# Unsupervised Outlier Model Selection (UOMS) 

----

**Background**: Given an unsupervised outlier detection task, how should one
select i) a detection algorithm, and ii) associated hyperparameter values (jointly called a model)? Effective outlier model
selection is essential as different algorithms may work well for
varying detection tasks, and moreover their performance can
be quite sensitive to the values of the hyperparameters (HPs).
